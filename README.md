⬆️ Evaluating Biochar for the Removal of
Pharmaceutical Pollutants from Wastewater
```

Biochar is a material produced by the thermal decomposition of organic waste
materials, such as crops, forestry residues, sewage sludge, algal biomass, and
poultry manure, under controlled conditions. Biochar is widely used as an
adsorbent to remove various pollutants from water and wastewater, including
organic contaminants, microplastics, heavy metals, and excess nutrients. With
the growing accumulation of pollutants in industrial, municipal, and agricul-
tural wastewater, this issue has become a pressing concern. The presence of
these pollutants in water negatively impacts crop yields, degrades environmen-
tal quality, and poses risks to human health.This project aims to evaluate the
effectiveness of biochar in comparison to other adsorbents and determine the
optimal conditions for its use in wastewater treatment. The effectiveness of
biochar depends on the type of raw materials used and the temperature during
the pyrolysis process.
